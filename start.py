  #in programming  you often need to know if an expression is true or false
  #you can evaluate any expression in python and get one or two ans , TRUE OR FALSE
  #WHEN u campare two values , the expression is evaluated and python return the boolean ans
# print(10 > 9) #true
# print(10 == 9) #false
# print(10 < 9) #false
#when you run a condition  in an if statement , python return TRUE OR FALSE

#PRINT a message based on whether the condition is true or false
# a = 200
# b = 33
# if b >a:
#     print("b is greater then a ")
# else:                       #output is showing b is not grater then a
#     print("b is not greater then a")
# evalute value and variables
#the bool() function allows you to evaluate any value and give you TRUE AND FALSE IN RETURN
#evalute a string  and a number
# print(bool("hello python"))
# print(bool(15))
#evalute two return
# X = "hello"
# y = 15
# print(bool, type(X))
# print(bool,type(y))
# almost any value is evaluated to true if it has some sort of content.
#Any string is true , except empty strings ,Any number is true , except 0
#Any list , tuple ,set and dictionary are true , except empty ones
# bool = ("abc")
# bool = (123)
# bool = (["apple","chery","banan"])
# print(bool)

# bool(0)
# bool(false)
# bool(none)
# bool("")
# bool(())
# bool([])
# bool({})
#example
# class myclass():  #you can crate functions that returns a boolean value
#     def __len__(self):
#         return 0
# myobj = myclass()
# print(bool(myobj))
# print "YWS " if the function returntrue  otherwie print "NO"
# def myfunction():
#      return False
# if myfunction():
#     print("yes!")
# else:
#     print("NO!")
#check if an object is an integer or not
# x = 200
# print(isinstance(x,int))  # python boolean is completed
