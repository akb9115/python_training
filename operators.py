# operators are used to operations on variables and values
#in the example below ,we used the  + operators to add togethors two values

# print(10 +5)
# x = 30  #division show with remainder
# y = 4
# print(x / y)

# x = 30  # only show by remainder
# y = 4
# print(x % y)

# x = 30
# y = 4
# print(x // y)  #only bhagfal will be showing
                       # Assignment operators
# x = 8
# x += 3
# # print(x)
# x = 37
# x %=9
# print(x)
# x = 8
# x &= 5
# print(x)
# x = int(input("enter the number :"))
# x = 67
# x = 5
#
# x <<= 3
#
# print(x)

# x = 5
#
# x ^= 3
#
# print(x)

x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x

print(x != y )
